Value of circulating tumor cells positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) to predict recurrence and survival rates for endometrial carcinoma. This study was conducted to analyze the predictive value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) expressing thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) on the recurrence and survival rates of endometrial carcinoma patients treated with laparoscopic surgery.,78 patients were recruited, diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma and measured CTC expressing TTF-1 using flow cytometry in blood and tissues. Then, the patients were distributed into TTF-1-positive (N=42) and -negative (N=36) groups. The levels of HE4 were determined by ELISA, the levels of cancer antigen CA125 and CA15.3 by chemiluminescent immunoassay, and the levels of mRNA expression of survivin, β-catenin, miR-15a, and PTEN by RT-PCR assay from endometrial carcinoma samples.,Patients in TTF-1-positive group had mainly TNM stages II and III-IV, whereas the TTF-1-negative group stages I and II predominated. The rates of vascular infiltration and lymphatic metastasis in the TTF-1-positive group were higher compared with the TTF-1-negative group (p<0.05). The serum levels of CA125, CA15.3, and HE4 were significantly higher in the TTF-1-positive group than in the TTF-1-negative group (p<0.05). The levels of survivin and β-catenin mRNA expression in endometrial carcinoma in the TTF-1-positive group was higher than in the TTF-1-negative group. In contrast, the levels of miR-15a and PTEN mRNA expression were lower in the TTF-1-positive group (p<0.05). The median follow-up duration was 25 months for both groups. At that time, progression-free survival (PFS) and the median survival time decreased in the TTF-1-positive group compared with the TTF-1-negative group. Additionally, the recurrence rate increased in the TTF-1-positive group.,The rate of TTF-1-positive CTC was strongly correlated with TNM staging, vascular infiltration, lymphatic metastasis, and the levels of CA125, CA15.3, and HE4 in endometrial carcinoma. The levels of survivin, β-catenin, miR-15a, and PTEN mRNA also contributed to predict survival rates after laparoscopic surgery.
Chromosome 8p as a potential hub for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders: implications for schizophrenia, autism and cancer. Defects in genetic and developmental processes are thought to contribute susceptibility to autism and schizophrenia. Presumably, owing to etiological complexity identifying susceptibility genes and abnormalities in the development has been difficult. However, the importance of genes within chromosomal 8p region for neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer is well established. There are 484 annotated genes located on 8p; many are most likely oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) that are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder and depression), neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and cancer. Furthermore, at least seven nonprotein-coding RNAs (microRNAs) are located at 8p. Structural variants on 8p, such as copy number variants, microdeletions or microduplications, might also contribute to autism, schizophrenia and other human diseases including cancer. In this review, we consider the current state of evidence from cytogenetic, linkage, association, gene expression and endophenotyping studies for the role of these 8p genes in neuropsychiatric disease. We also describe how a mutation in an 8p gene (Fgf17) results in a mouse with deficits in specific components of social behavior and a reduction in its dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We finish by discussing the biological connections of 8p with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer, despite the shortcomings of this evidence.
Limb girdle muscular dystrophies. Limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of primary myopathies involving progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the hip and shoulder girdles, with distal spread to the bulbar or respiratory musculature in rare cases. Depending on the mode of genetic transmission, six autosomal dominant forms (LGMD1A-F, 10-25%) and ten autosomal recessive forms (LGMD2A-J, 75-90%) are currently known. The prevalence of LGMDs is 0.8/100,000. These conditions are caused by mutations in genes encoding for myotilin (5q31, LGMD1A), lamin A/C (1q11-q21.2, LGMD1B), caveolin-3 (3p25, LGMD1C), unknown proteins (7q, LGMD1D, 6q23, LGMD1E, 7q32.1-32.2., LGMD1F), calpain-3 (15q15.1-21.1, LGMD2A), dysferlin (2p13.3-13.1, LGMD2B), gamma-sarcoglycan (13q12, LGMD2C), alpha-sarcoglycan, also known as adhalin (17q12-q21.3, LGMD2D), beta-sarcoglycan (4q12, LGMD2E), delta-sarcoglycan (5q33-q34, LGMD2F), telethonin (17q11-q12, LGMD2G), E3-ubiquitin ligase (9q31-q34.1, LGMD2H), fukutin-related protein (19q13.3, LGMD2I), and titin (2q31, LGMD2J). Cardiac involvement has been described for LGMD1B-E, LGMD2C-G, and LGMD2I. The time of onset varies between early childhood and middle age. There is no male or female preponderance. Disease progression and life expectancy vary widely, even among different members of the same family. The diagnosis is based primarily on DNA analysis. The history, clinical neurological examinations, blood chemistry investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy also provide information that is helpful for the diagnosis. No causal therapy is currently available.
The PTEN phosphatase functions cooperatively with the Fanconi anemia proteins in DNA crosslink repair. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk. The FA proteins function primarily in DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. Here, we have examined the role of the PTEN phosphatase in this process. We have established that PTEN-deficient cells, like FA cells, exhibit increased cytotoxicity, chromosome structural aberrations, and error-prone mutagenic DNA repair following exposure to ICL-inducing agents. The increased ICL sensitivity of PTEN-deficient cells is caused, in part, by elevated PLK1 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of FANCM, constitutive FANCM polyubiquitination and degradation, and the consequent inefficient assembly of the FA core complex, FANCD2, and FANCI into DNA repair foci. We also establish that PTEN function in ICL repair is dependent on its protein phosphatase activity and ability to be SUMOylated, yet is independent of its lipid phosphatase activity. Finally, via epistasis analysis, we demonstrate that PTEN and FANCD2 function cooperatively in ICL repair.
Current insights into renal ciliopathies: what can genetics teach us? Ciliopathies are a group of clinically and genetically overlapping disorders whose etiologies lie in defective cilia. These are antenna-like organelles on the apical surface of numerous cell types in a variety of tissues and organs, the kidney included. Cilia play essential roles during development and tissue homeostasis, and their dysfunction in the kidney has been associated with renal cyst formation and renal failure. Recently, the term "renal ciliopathies" was coined for those human genetic disorders that are characterized by nephronophthisis, cystic kidneys or renal cystic dysplasia. This review focuses on renal ciliopathies from a human genetics perspective. We survey the newest insights with respect to gene identification and genotype-phenotype correlations, and we reflect on candidate ciliopathies. The opportunities and challenges of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for genetic renal research and clinical DNA diagnostics are also reviewed, and we discuss the contribution of NGS to the development of personalized therapy for patients with renal ciliopathies.
Associations between NOD2, IRGM and ORMDL3 polymorphisms and pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease in the Lithuanian population. Recent GWAS and meta-analyses have revealed about 200 susceptibility genes/loci for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, only a small number of studies were performed in early-onset IBD. The aim of this study was to assess the association between NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, IL10, NKX2-3 and ORMDL3 variants and early-onset IBD. A total of 76 affected individuals (30 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 46 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) at the age of ≤17 years and 158 matched controls recruited in Lithuania were genotyped for the known genetic susceptibility variants in NOD2 (Arg702Trp (rs2066844), Gly908Arg (rs2066845) and Leu1007insC (rs2066847)), IL23R (rs11209026), ATG16L1 (rs2241880), IRGM (rs4958847), IL10 (rs3024505), NKX2-3 (rs11190140) and ORMDL3 (rs2872507) genes. Variants in NOD2 (Leu1007insC) and IRGM genes increased risk for CD (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 2.54-16.91, P=1.21×10 The results confirmed that polymorphisms in NOD2 (Leu1007insC) and  IRGM genes are associated with increased risk of CD; whereas the ORMDL3 variant is associated with susceptibility to UC in the Lithuanian early-onset IBD population.
Deubiquitinase Usp8 regulates α-synuclein clearance and modifies its toxicity in Lewy body disease. In Parkinson’s disease, misfolded α-synuclein accumulates, often in a ubiquitinated form, in neuronal inclusions termed Lewy bodies. An important outstanding question is whether ubiquitination in Lewy bodies is directly relevant to α-synuclein trafficking or turnover and Parkinson’s pathogenesis. By comparative analysis in human postmortem brains, we found that ubiquitin immunoreactivity in Lewy bodies is largely due to K63-linked ubiquitin chains and markedly reduced in the substantia nigra compared with the neocortex. The ubiquitin staining in cells with Lewy bodies inversely correlated with the content and pathological localization of the deubiquitinase Usp8. Usp8 interacted and partly colocalized with α-synuclein in endosomal membranes and, both in cells and after purification, it deubiquitinated K63-linked chains on α-synuclein. Knockdown of Usp8 in the Drosophila eye reduced α-synuclein levels and α-synuclein–induced eye toxicity. Accordingly, in human cells, Usp8 knockdown increased the lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein. In the dopaminergic neurons of the Drosophila model, unlike knockdown of other deubiquitinases, Usp8 protected from α-synuclein–induced locomotor deficits and cell loss. These findings strongly suggest that removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on α-synuclein by Usp8 is a critical mechanism that reduces its lysosomal degradation in dopaminergic neurons and may contribute to α-synuclein accumulation in Lewy body disease.
The three 'P's of mitophagy: PARKIN, PINK1, and post-translational modifications. Two Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated proteins, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the E3-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase PARKIN, are central to mitochondrial quality control. In this pathway, PINK1 accumulates on defective mitochondria, eliciting the translocation of PARKIN from the cytosol to mediate the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). Throughout the different stages of mitophagy, post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical for the regulation of PINK1 and PARKIN activity and function. Indeed, activation and recruitment of PARKIN onto damaged mitochondria involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both PARKIN and Ub. Through a stepwise cascade, PARKIN is converted from an autoinhibited enzyme into an active phospho-Ub-dependent E3 ligase. Upon activation, PARKIN ubiquitinates itself in concert with many different mitochondrial substrates. The Ub conjugates attached to these substrates can in turn be phosphorylated by PINK1, which triggers further cycles of PARKIN recruitment and activation. This feed-forward amplification loop regulates both PARKIN activity and mitophagy. However, the precise steps and sequence of PTMs in this cascade are only now being uncovered. For instance, the Ub conjugates assembled by PARKIN consist predominantly of noncanonical K6-linked Ub chains. Moreover, these modifications are reversible and can be disassembled by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including Ub-specific protease 8 (USP8), USP15, and USP30. However, PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub can impede the activity of these DUBs, adding a new layer of complexity to the regulation of PARKIN-mediated mitophagy by PTMs. It is therefore evident that further insight into how PTMs regulate the PINK1-PARKIN pathway will be critical for our understanding of mitochondrial quality control.
Open Targets: a platform for therapeutic target identification and validation. We have designed and developed a data integration and visualization platform that provides evidence about the association of known and potential drug targets with diseases. The platform is designed to support identification and prioritization of biological targets for follow-up. Each drug target is linked to a disease using integrated genome-wide data from a broad range of data sources. The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease. Users can easily transition between these target- and disease-centric workflows. The Open Targets Validation Platform is accessible at https://www.targetvalidation.org.
Efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with melanoma brain metastases. BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibodies in patients (pts) with melanoma brain metastasis (BM), particularly those which are symptomatic. METHOD: We retrospectively assessed pts with melanoma BM treated with PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Clinicopathologic and treatment parameters were collected and outcomes determined for intracranial (IC) response rate (RR) using a modified RECIST criteria, with up to five IC target lesions used to determine IC response, disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 66 pts were identified with a median follow up of 7.0 months (range 0.8-24.5 months). A total of 68% were male and 45% BRAF V600 mutation positive. At PD-1 antibody commencement, 50% had an elevated LDH; 64% had local therapy to BM prior to commencing anti-PD1, of which 5% had surgical resection, 14% stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), 18% whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), 27% had surgery and radiotherapy. Twenty-one per cent started anti-PD-1 as first line systemic therapy. No pt had prior anti-PD-1 treatment. The IC overall RR was 21 and DCR 56%. Responses occurred in 21% of pts with symptomatic BM. The median OS was 9.9 months (95% CI 6.93-17.74). Pts with symptomatic BM had shorter PFS than those without symptoms (2.7 vs 7.4 months, P=0.035) and numerically shorter OS (5.7 vs 13.0 months, P=0.068). Pts requiring corticosteroids also had a numerically shorter PFS (3.2 vs 7.4 months, P=0.081) and OS (4.8 vs 13.1 months, P=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: IC responses to anti-PD-1 antibodies occur in pts with BM, including those with symptomatic BM requiring corticosteroids. Prospective trials evaluating anti-PD-1 therapy in pts with BM are underway
P53 and Murine Double Mimute 2 (MDM2) Expression Changes and Significance in Different Types of Endometrial Lesions.  Endometrial lesions are common in obstetrics and gynecology, including endometrial polyps, uterine adenomyosis, and malignant endometrial adenocarcinoma. Endometrial lesions seriously affect women's health, fertility, quality of life, and life safety. As a pro-apoptosis gene, p53 is considered to be closely related with human tumors. Murine double mimute 2 (MDM2) is an oncogene that can promote tumor occurrence and development. P53 and MDM2 expression and significance in different types of endometrial lesions have not been fully elucidated. Normal endometrium, endometrial polyps, uterine adenomyosis, and endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue samples were collected. Real-time PCR was used to detect p53 and MDM2 mRNA expression. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis were applied to test p53 and MDM2 protein expression. Their correlation with clinical staging of endometrial adenocarcinoma was analyzed. RESULTS P53 and MDM2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly elevated in the endometrial polyps group and the endometrial adenocarcinoma group compared with the normal control group (P<0.05). Their levels increased more obviously in endometrial adenocarcinoma compared with endometrial polyps (P<0.05). P53 and MDM2 mRNA and protein expression were slightly enhanced in uterine adenomyosis compared with normal controls, but this difference lacked statistical significance (P>0.05). P53 and MDM2 mRNA and protein level showed a positive correlation. Significantly higher expression of p53 or MDM2 was observed in patients with stage III compared to those in patients with stage II. Higher expression was also observed in patients with stage II than in patients with stage I. P53 and MDM2 mRNA and protein were elevated in endometrial polyps and endometrial adenocarcinoma and their expressions were correlated with clinical staging of endometrial adenocarcinoma. They can promote cancer occurrence and development, and can be treated to assist diagnosis and provide a reference for treatment.Psychological Symptoms Among Patients With BCR-ABL-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms. BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases, including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and myelofibrosis (MF). Psychological manifestations among these diseases have not been adequately described. Cross-sectional surveys measuring distress, anxiety, and depression were collected from patients with BCR-ABL-negative MPNs from May 2015 to October 2015. Participants provided demographic information and completed the Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DT&PL) to assess distress and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess distress, anxiety, and depression. They provided information on how their MPN affected their lives. Of the 117 participants, 31.2% had PV, 28.4% had ET, 28.4% had MF, and 11.9% had another type of MPN. Time with MPN varied from less than 1 year (7.5%), 1 to 3 years (19.8%), 3 to 5 years (23.6%), 5 to 10 years (19.8%), and more than 10 years (29.2%). Distress averaged 3.14 (SD, 2.83; DT&PL), with 40.4% meeting NCCN criteria for distress, and averaged 8.97 (SD, 7.44; HADS), with 38.5% meeting HADS criteria for distress. Anxiety averaged 5.54 (SD, 4.37), with 31.3% meeting HADS criteria for anxiety. Depression averaged 3.4 (SD, 3.4), with 12.5% meeting HADS criteria for depression. Distress was higher for PV (3.86), MF (3.12), and "other" MPN (4.33) than it was for ET (1.81; P=.016). Distress was more common in non-white patients (P=.015) and those with either PV or MF but not ET (DT&PL ≥4; P=.038). Patients' comments described coping strategies or symptom burden.Distress and anxiety are highly prevalent with BCR - ABL - negative MPNs and may correspond to disease-related symptom burden.These findings deserve further study.
Cervical cancer growth is regulated by a c-ABL-PLK1 signaling axis. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-ABL controls cell growth but its contributions in solid tumors are not fully understood. Here we report that the Polo-like kinase PLK1, an essential mitotic kinase regulator, is an important downstream effector of c-ABL in regulating the growth of cervical cancer. c-ABL interacted with and phosphorylated PLK1. Phosphorylation of PLK1 by c-ABL inhibited PLK1 ubiquitination and degradation and enhanced its activity, leading to cell cycle progression and tumor growth. Both c-ABL and PLK1 were overexpressed in cervical carcinoma. Notably, PLK1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with patient survival in cervical cancer.Crohn's disease accompanied by nonspecific or idiopathic ulcerative proctocolitis corresponds to a condition called intestinal inflammatory disease. The immunoexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in Crohn's disease becomes more marked with progression of the disease and the presence of wild-type p53 suppresses the transcription of COX-2. To investigate the immunoexpression of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), COX-2 and p53 in Crohn's ileocolitis and to correlated this expression with clinical and histopathological parameters. Forty-five cases of Crohn's disease, 16 cases of actinic colitis (diseased-control group) and 11 cases without a history of intestinal disease (normal control group) were studied. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were submitted to histopathological analysis and the immunohistochemical expression of COX-1, COX-2 and p53 was evaluated by the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Sixty percent of the Crohn's disease patients were women and 40% were men, with 75.5% whites and 25.5% non-whites. The disease involved the terminal ileum in 44.5% of cases, ileum in 33.3%, colon in 20% and duodenum-ileum in 2.2%. A significant association was observed between COX-2 immunoreactivity and age < or =40 years. Histopathological analysis of Crohn's disease samples showed mild or moderate crypt distortion (57.8% and 35.6% of cases), atrophy (6.6%), mild, moderate and marked chronic inflammation (46.7%, 26.7% and 20%), acute inflammatory activity (93.3%), ulceration (24.4%), mucin depletion (37.8%), Paneth's cells (24.4%), intraepithelial lymphocytes (93.3%), and subepithelial collagen (6.7%). In the CD group, COX-1 immunoreactivity in epithelial and inflammatory cells was observed in 26.7% and 22.2% of cases, respectively. COX-2 immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial cells in 68.9% of cases and in inflammatory cells in 46.7%. A marginal difference in COX-2 reactivity was observed between epithelial and inflammatory cells in association with acute inflammatory activity and increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Comparison of the date among the threes groups (Crohn's disease, actinic colitis and normal controls) showed a higher proportion of cases presenting COX-2 immunoreactivity in inflammatory cells in the Crohn's disease group. No p53 reactivity was observed in all cases. COX-2 immunoexpression is high in Crohn's disease, which suggest a possible role of the protein in the pathogenesis of the inflammation. The absence of epithelial dysplasia in all Crohn's disease samples was correlated with the lack of expression of p53.
Therapeutic interventions in severe asthma. Therapeutic interventions in severe asthma. The present paper addresses severe asthma which is limited to 5-10% of the overall population of asthmatics. However, it accounts for 50% or more of socials costs of the disease, as it is responsible for hospitalizations and Emergency Department accesses as well as expensive treatments. The recent identification of different endotypes of asthma, based on the inflammatory pattern, has led to the development of tailored treatments that target different inflammatory mediators. These are major achievements in the perspective of Precision Medicine: a leading approach to the modern treatment strategy. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, has been the only biologic treatment available on the market for severe asthma during the last decade. It prevents the linkage of the IgE and the receptors, thereby inhibiting mast cell degranulation. In clinical practice omalizumab significantly reduced the asthma exacerbations as well as the concomitant use of oral glucocorticoids. In the "Th2-high asthma" phenotype, the hallmarks are increased levels of eosinophils and other markers (such as periostin). Because anti-IL-5 in this condition plays a crucial role in driving eosinophil inflammation, this cytokine or its receptors on the eosinophil surface has been studied as a potential target for therapy. Two different anti-IL-5 humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been proven effective in this phenotype of asthma (recently they both came on the market in the United States), as well as an anti-IL-5 receptor alpha (IL5Rα), benralizumab. Other monoclonal antibodies, targeting different cytokines (IL-13, IL-4, IL-17 and TSLP) are still under evaluation, though the preliminary results are encouraging. Finally, AIT, Allergen Immunotherapy, a prototype of Precision Medicine, is considered, also in light of the recent evidences of Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) tablet efficacy and safety in mite allergic asthma patients. Given the high costs of these therapies, however, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can predict the clinical responders.
Schistosoma mansoni antigens alter activation markers and cytokine profile in lymphocytes of patients with asthma. Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway inflammation, obstruction and hyperresponsiveness. Severe asthma affects a small proportion of subjects but results in most of the morbidity, costs and mortality associated with the disease. Studies have suggested that Schistosoma mansoni infection reduces the severity of asthma and prevent atopy. We evaluated the ability of S. mansoni antigens, Sm29 and Sm29TSP-2 to modulate lymphocyte activation status in response to the allergen of the mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1) in cell cultures of individuals with asthma. Thirty four patients were enrolled in this study: seventeen patients with severe asthma (SA group), seventeen patients with mild asthma (MA group) and six controls with no asthma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained and stimulated with Sm29 and Sm29TSP-2 in the presence or absence of Der p1. The expression of surface markers and cytokines on lymphocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry and the levels of IL-10 in the culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. The addition of Sm29 and Sm29TSP-2 antigens to PBMC cultures from both groups of subjects with asthma stimulated with Der p1 reduced the frequency of CD4 These results suggest that the addition of Sm29 and Sm29TSP-2 to the cells cultures from subjects with asthma reduced cell activation markers and altered the cytokine production pattern in a way that can potentialy control the inflammatory response associated with asthma.
Schistosoma mansoni antigens alter activation markers and cytokine profile in lymphocytes of patients with asthma.Inhibition of interleukin-5 induced false positive anti-drug antibody responses against mepolizumab through the use of a competitive blocking antibody. Mepolizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks native homodimeric interleukin-5 (IL-5) from binding to the IL-5 receptor, has recently been approved for treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. Our initial immunogenicity assay method for phase I and II studies utilized a bridging electrochemiluminescence format with biotin and ruthenium-labelled mepolizumab linked by anti-drug antibodies (ADA). We discovered that IL-5 significantly increased in dosed subjects from a phase II study and that the increased IL-5 was in the form of a drug-bound complex. We demonstrated that the elevated drug-bound IL-5 produced false-positive response in the in vitro ADA assay, in which drug-bound IL-5 dissociated and then bridged mepolizumab conjugates to yield positive signal. To eliminate the IL-5 interference, we compared two strategies: a solid-phase immunodepletion of IL-5 and an in-solution IL-5 immunocompetition. We identified the best competitive antibody for each purpose. We found both methods demonstrated similar effectiveness in reducing the false positive signal in IL-5 spiked samples; however, the in-solution immunocompetition for IL-5 had fewer false positives in study samples. Additionally, the in-solution immunocompetition method was experimentally simpler to execute. We modified the ADA assay by adding a pre-treatment step with a mepolizumab competitive anti- IL-5 antibody. Using this new method, we retested clinical samples from two phase II studies (MEA112997 and MEA114092). The confirmed ADA positive incidence was reduced from 29% and 61% to 1% and 8% with the modified in-solution immune inhibition method. Target interference is a fairly common problem facing immunogenicity testing, and target-induced false positive cannot be distinguished from true ADA response by the commonly used drug competitive confirmation assay. The approach and method used here for resolving target interference in ADA detection will be useful for differentiating between a true ADA response and target induced false positive as well as similar challenges in other programs.
Current clinical genomics assays primarily utilize short-read sequencing (SRS), which offers high throughput, high base accuracy, and low cost per base. SRS has, however, limited ability to evaluate tandem repeats, regions with high [GC] or [AT] content, highly polymorphic regions, highly paralogous regions, and large-scale structural variants. Long-read sequencing (LRS) has complementary strengths and offers a means to discover overlooked genetic variation in patients undiagnosed by SRS. To evaluate LRS, we selected a patient who presented with multiple neoplasia and cardiac myxomata suggestive of Carney complex for whom targeted clinical gene testing and whole genome SRS were negative. Low coverage whole genome LRS was performed on the PacBio Sequel system and structural variants were called, yielding 6,971 deletions and 6,821 insertions > 50bp. Filtering for variants that are absent in an unrelated control and that overlap a coding exon of a disease gene identified three deletions and three insertions. One of these, a heterozygous 2,184 bp deletion, overlaps the first coding exon of PRKAR1A, which is implicated in autosomal dominant Carney complex. This variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was classified as pathogenic using standard criteria for the interpretation of sequence variants. This first successful application of whole genome LRS to identify a pathogenic variant suggests that LRS has significant potential to identify disease-causing structural variation. We recommend larger studies to evaluate the diagnostic yield of LRS, and the development of a comprehensive catalog of common human structural variation to support future studies.
Anti-interleukin 5 Therapy for Eosinophilic Asthma: a Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.Recently,  more and more clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the effects of anti-interleukin (IL)-5 antibodies in eosinophilic asthma. However, a confirm conclusion has not been well established. We therefore sought to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the overall efficacy and safety of anti-interleukin 5 treatments in eosinophilic asthma. RCTs of anti-interleukin 5 treatments in eosinophilic asthma published up to June 2016 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library databases, and CBM, which reported pulmonary functions, quality-of-life scores, asthmatic exacerbations, and adverse events were included. Fixed-effect models were used to calculate mean difference, relative risks (RR), and 95 % CIs. Twelve studies involving 3340 patients were identified. Pooled analysis revealed significant improvements in FEV.
